        <h3>Octopus Falafel Truck</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Falafel Truck! Every day is a different experience of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine. Everything is prepared fresh and cooked on my charcoal grill. Each day is a special selection from the Chef to make sure each bite is fresh and right off the grill. Every dish has been specially prepared to match flavors and create an eating experience that is sure to bring a smile, or at least that is my wish to everyone who comes by.
